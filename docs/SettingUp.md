# Setting Up the Project

Follow the steps in the following guide precisely. Things will not work out if you deviate in some steps.

First, **fork** this repo, and **clone** the fork into your computer.

If you plan to use Intellij IDEA (highly recommended):

1. **Configure the JDK**: Follow the guide [[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Configuring the JDK](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijJdk.html) to to ensure Intellij is configured to use **JDK 11**.

2. **Import the project as a Gradle project**: Follow the guide [[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Importing a Gradle project](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijImportGradleProject.html) to import the project into IDEA. _Importing a Gradle project is slightly different from importing a normal Java project._

3. **Verify the setup**: Run the `seedu.zoomaster.Zoomaster` and try a few commands.
